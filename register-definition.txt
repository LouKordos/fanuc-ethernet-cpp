R[21] = Switch case register to determine mode, 0 is FINE High speed Skip, 1 is CNT100 normal skip, (THIS MIGHT NOT BE CORRECT, STILL NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED)
R[5] = Speed register, used in move commands to control the speed
PR[1] = Position setpoint used by TP program
PR[4] = Set by high speed skip to position when it skips
